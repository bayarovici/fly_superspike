## Intro

#SuperSpike is an approximate surrogate gradient method. The algorithm runs fully online and constitutes a three-factor rule capabable training recurrent and multi-layer spiking neural networks to perform complex spatiotemporal input output mappings. The present repository introduces the key classes extending the Auryn library to run SuperSpike and illustrates how to train a simple three layer network using either random or symmetric error feedback. 

#The present code was freshly optimized and should be considered alpha stage. Please report bugs on GitHub and use the forum (https://fzenke.net/auryn/forum/index.php) for questions and discussions.

## Requirements

You will need a working compiled version of the Auryn library (https://github.com/fzenke/auryn).
We have tested this with commit 6f88977da186e874c75ce3cdbba59d83748fe53c.
