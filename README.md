#  Odour learning using SuperSpike



## Intro

Fruit fly's olfactory circuit simulated using SuperSpike. Code uses Friedemann Zenke's Auryn library and modifies code from the following paper:


Zenke, F., and Ganguli, S. (2018). SuperSpike: Supervised Learning in Multilayer Spiking Neural Networks. Neural Computation 30, 1514â€“1541.

## Requirements

You will need a working compiled version of the Auryn library (https://github.com/fzenke/auryn).
